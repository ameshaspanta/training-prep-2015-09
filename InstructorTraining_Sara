I am a prospective PhD student in Computer Science and my PhD will start from Spring semester 2016, my main interest  is bioinformatics and also during my master I worked in bioinformatic problem.
Most of the time I use R to analyze microarray data. I also have work experiences in developing the core banking system and work with big data via SQL/Oracle Database. Also I have teaching experiences on computer programming C, C++.

I would be more than happy to work with Software Carprentry because I believe it would be  a wonderful opportunity for me to boost my knowledge and experiences in teaching.
